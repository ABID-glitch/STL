* CONTAINERS: These are used to contain or manage objects of certain kind
Containers library in STL provides such containers that use to create data structures like arrays, linked list and
trees, etc.
* VECTORS can be used to create dynamic arrays of data types int, float, char, etc.
* ALGORITHM: Algorithms acts on containers it is a mean by which we performs sorting, searching and transforming the
contents of the containers. Algorithm library contains the built in functions which performs complex algorithms
which are performed on data structures
* ITERATORS: Iterators are like bridge between vectors and algorithms. They actually points to the containers
